Hi ðŸ‘‹. I'm Ohi. I am a fresh computer science grad interested on research and development. My interest covers artificial intelligence, deep learning and statistical analysis. My core skills are **Python, Keras, Tensorflow, and MatplotLib**. On the contrary, my minor skills cover **Flask (micro web framework) and Flutter (Android-IOS app development)**. Apart from these, I have been an active Competitive Programmer and competed in more than 10 international and national contests including the ICPC and NCPC.
